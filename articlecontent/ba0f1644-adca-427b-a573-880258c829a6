2019 in pictures: Striking images from around the UK
In February, students around the country walked out of schools to call on the government to declare a climate emergency and take active steps to tackle the problem. Organisers Youth Strike 4 Climate said about 15,000 people had protested, in more than 60 towns and cities. Later in the year, a global climate strike saw millions of people around the world demonstrate for "an end to the age of fossil fuels and climate justice for everyone".
