0,0.0,fox-news,"Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Benji Backer: How to depolarize the climate change debate"
1,-64.86,fox-news,"For too long, the climate change debate in Washington, D.C, has circled around who denies what and when the world may end. On Twitter and other social media, the debate has turned eating a hamburger or vegetable into a partisan argument. Climate change has become a polarizing, partisan topic. It shouldn’t be."
2,90.01,fox-news,"On one hand, Republicans have done a poor job explaining how our free-market clean energy solutions are climate solutions. On the other hand, the Democratic Party has seemingly aimed to out-radicalize itself every day with increasingly alarmist and unrealistic climate change proposals that stand no chance of becoming law."
3,49.39,fox-news,"The Green New Deal, or most ideas from Democratic presidential primary candidates, only turn away necessary voices and push aside potential feasible policies. While science doesn’t say we only have 12 years to save our climate, it’s undeniable that humans impact our naturally ever-changing environment."
4,92.74,fox-news,"So what’s a realistic policy? It won’t come from one single piece of legislation, but from many free-market solutions that unleash American ingenuity and leadership. It’s these solutions that create jobs, clean up the environment for future generations, and build consensus around the common ground to care for the world around us."
5,75.06,fox-news,"Take, for example, Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). It’s a clean building product that proves innovation is how we can combat climate change, grow the economy, and raise our standard of living. It emits fewer emissions to manufacture than other tall building products and acts as a carbon-capture product. It’s estimated that the use of CLT and other mass timber for the construction of tall buildings could reduce emissions by up to 20 percent. It will also stimulate economic growth in America’s rural, timber-dependent communities."
6,97.16,fox-news,"Congresswoman Rodgers has also prioritized hydropower as a source of clean energy for her district, promoted carbon-neutral biomass, and helped mitigate catastrophic forest fires that contribute to climate change. She has also led on streamlining relicensing processes to spur the development of clean energy resources and passed bipartisan legislation to encourage the use of small conduit hydropower projects to diversify our clean energy portfolio. Last Congress, she introduced a bill that focused on modernizing hydropower — which powers 70 percent of Washington state — and it passed in the House with strong bipartisan support."
7,44.04,fox-news,"On the grassroots side, the American Conservation Coalition has built a presence on 180 college campuses nationwide, helped form the Republican Party’s first bicameral environmentally-focused caucus, and brought countless conservative students to Capitol Hill advocating for important climate and energy reforms."
8,86.58,fox-news,"In September, we testified with Greta Thunberg before Congress on the importance of pragmatic climate change solutions. We’re changing the narrative that conservatives don’t care about the environment by building a strong base on these issues."
9,54.23,fox-news,"The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction."
10,54.23,fox-news,"For too long, this debate has centered on politicians pointing fingers to the other side. For Americans looking for solutions, it’s an old and boring story — and we agree. It’s time for something new and bold leadership on ideas that work."
11,-29.6,fox-news,Climate change should no longer be partisan — or generational.
12,94.68,fox-news,"The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction. Solutions like CLT and hydropower are already here, and there are more innovations to come that will ensure America leads on clean energy, creating jobs, keeping energy prices affordable, and reducing carbon emissions."
13,73.64,fox-news,"Why not promote what raises our standard of living today and helps us leave our home better off than we found it? With solutions and results that benefit everyone, that’s a no-brainer. It’s also far more productive than the time wasted on partisan talking points, especially when technology and innovation are already making a difference."
14,72.69,fox-news,"This is a global problem, and it requires both parties leading on a global solution. America led the world in the development of coal, oil and gas, and now we can lead the world in clean energy technology."
15,38.18,fox-news,"Benjamin (Benji) Backer is the president and founder of the American Conservation Coalition, a member-based nonprofit focused on market-based, limited-government environmentalism. He is a senior at the University of Washington and a conservative activist, hiker and skier."
16,20.23,fox-news,Leslie Marshall: Top impeachment takeaways (from a Democrat's perspective)
17,0.0,fox-news,"Having watched House impeachment hearings held by two committees that have spent the past few weeks examining the conduct of President Trump, here are four takeaways from my perspective as a Democrat."
18,27.32,fox-news,I’ve concluded that the old saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” applies to impeachment as well.
19,0.0,fox-news,It seems that most Democrats watching the hearings believe there is overwhelming evidence to justify President Trump’s impeachment – while most Republicans seem to think the exact opposite.
20,0.0,fox-news,Our country is so divided that Democrats and Republicans are living in two alternate realities when it comes to evaluating Trump’s conduct.
21,40.19,fox-news,"According to the latest RealClear Politics average of polls, 48 percent of voters support impeaching and removing Trump from office, while and 46.2 percent oppose removing him – close enough to call it a statistical tie. These numbers haven’t changed much since the hearings began."
22,63.69,fox-news,"When you break those figures down by political party the differences are dramatic. Among Democrats, 87.2 percent of voters would like to see Trump impeached and removed. But among independents, the comparable figure is only 44.5 percent. And among Republicans, it’s just 8.8 percent."
23,10.27,fox-news,"As a Democrat, it seems clear to me that Trump improperly sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their activities in Ukraine."
24,86.89,fox-news,It also seems clear that Trump sought such an announcement of an investigation because he believes that there’s a good chance Joe Biden will be the Democratic presidential nominee next year and thinks Biden would be a strong candidate.
25,-61.15,fox-news,"So negative news coverage of Joe Biden and his son – who reportedly was paid as much as $80,000 a month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company when his father was vice president – could help derail Biden’s candidacy or at least weaken him and make him easier for Trump to defeat."
26,34.0,fox-news,"That makes a Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens a thing of value to Trump – and he was willing to hold back nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to get the investigation. That’s impeachable in the minds of many Democrats, including me."
27,0.0,fox-news,"Republicans – including some who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 – are contorting themselves to justify his conduct, and judging him very differently than they judged Democrats in the past."
28,0.0,fox-news,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was a House member in 1998 and 1999 when Democratic President Bill Clinton went through his impeachment in the House and trial in the Senate, and was as one of the managers of the impeachment effort."
29,72.93,fox-news,"“You do not even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic if this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role,” Rep. Graham said of Clinton. “|Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing of the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.”"
30,-51.06,fox-news,And Graham said in 1999: “The day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is the day that he was subject to impeachment.”
31,-36.12,fox-news,So why does Graham now feel that President Trump should be subject to different rules and should be allowed to get away with telling officials in his administration to ignore subpoenas to testify in the Trump impeachment hearings?
32,44.04,fox-news,"Obviously, because Graham doesn’t want to turn on a fellow Republican the way he eagerly turned on Democrat Clinton."
33,0.0,fox-news,"Republicans claim that Democrats originally were holding the impeachment inquiry regarding Trump in secret, despite 47 House Republicans being allowed to attend “secret” depositions."
34,45.88,fox-news,"Back in 1998, when Independent Counsel Kenneth Star was doing an extensive investigation of President Clinton, it was done behind closed doors and in the secrecy of a grand jury."
35,-27.32,fox-news,And the claim that President Trump had no lawyer present and there’s no ability to cross-examine witnesses? That is exactly what happened with Clinton.
36,-78.45,fox-news,"On top of this, after Republicans complained and complained that Trump was not allowed to have a lawyer present at the beginning stages of the investigation of his conduct, the president rejected an offer to have his own lawyer take part in the House Judiciary Committee hearing held Wednesday."
37,36.12,fox-news,"In another example of hypocrisy, Republicans are saying Hunter Biden only got his seat on the board of the Burisma natural gas company in Ukraine because his father was then vice president."
38,-20.52,fox-news,But where are the Republican complaints about Trump’s daughter and son-in-law working in the White House in high-level positions despite having no experience in government?
39,-7.72,fox-news,"In another example of hypocrisy, Republicans expressed outrage Wednesday when Stanford University Law Professor Pamela Karlan used some clever wordplay to make the point that President Trump is an elected official, not a monarch."
40,0.0,fox-news,"“While the president can name his son Barron, he can’t make him a baron,” Karlan said."
41,-73.51,fox-news,"Now, there is nothing in that statement attacking 13-year-old Barron Trump or even disparaging him. The point is about the limit of President’s Trump’s power."
42,-38.18,fox-news,But Republicans attacked Karlan ferociously for daring to mention Barron.
43,-83.13,fox-news,"First lady Melania Trump tweeted: “A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.”"
44,-74.3,fox-news,"Where was the Republican outrage when President Trump recently attacked Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who is 16?"
45,-51.06,fox-news,"And where was the Republican outrage when Rush Limbaugh referred to then-12-year old Chelsea Clinton as ""the White House dog?”"
46,27.32,fox-news,"There was also a question posed to Karlan about her donating money to Democrats. Well, guess who else has donated to Democratic candidates in past years? Former Democrat Donald Trump."
47,45.76,fox-news,"Rep Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tried to catch Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman in a gotcha moment Wednesday and ended up allowing Feldman to make an even more convincing case for Trump's impeachment."
48,0.0,fox-news,"And Rep Doug Collins, R-Ga., suggested that Professor Karlan had not read witness testimony from the former hearings."
49,27.82,fox-news,"Karlan responded: “Here, Mr. Collins, I would like to say to you, sir, that I read transcripts of every one of the witnesses who appeared in the live hearing, because I would not speak about these things without reviewing the facts, so I’m insulted by the suggestion that as a law professor I don’t care about those facts.”"
50,79.06,fox-news,House Democratic leaders have signaled they hope to wrap up impeachment proceedings in their chamber before Congress leaves for the December holidays. That means they’d like to take a final vote on impeaching Trump in a little over two weeks.
51,-27.32,fox-news,The lone Republican witness at Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing – George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley – said Democrats were moving too fast and should let the courts decide whether subpoenaed witnesses must testify before Congress.
52,-5.16,fox-news,"""If you rush this impeachment, you're going to leave half the country behind,"" Turley said. ""You have to give the time to build a record. This isn't an impulse buy item."""
53,0.0,fox-news,And Turley – who testified that there is not enough evidence now to impeach Trump – even suggested that Democrats “want to set the record for fastest impeachment.”
54,-32.52,fox-news,"But that’s not true. If the House votes on impeachment just before Christmas, it will have considered the Trump impeachment longer than the House considered President Clinton’s impeachment."
55,-51.06,fox-news,"And it’s obvious that no matter how fast or slow Democrats move on impeachment, they will be criticized by Republicans. The longer the impeachment inquiry goes, the closer we get to the November 2020 elections. If the House delays a vote on impeachment for months (which won’t happen), Republicans would say we should let voters decide if they want Trump to say in the White House."
56,-54.99,fox-news,"In the end, I think the conventional wisdom about what will happen with impeachment is correct. The Democratically-controlled House will vote to impeach Trump, but the Republican-controlled Senate will fail to convict him of anything after a trial."
57,7.72,fox-news,And then it really will be up to the American people to decide if they want Donald Trump to be our president for four more years.
58,-62.49,fox-news,Dan Gainor: 2019 was American journalism’s worst year ever – Here are 7 reasons why
59,-91.86,fox-news,"American journalism experienced its worst year ever in 2019, marked by bias, hatred and incompetence in the left-wing media."
60,-57.19,fox-news,"From coverage of the phony Russia collusion narrative, to the hit job on Covington Catholic High School students, to the media-led impeachment fiasco, the year was one of unparalleled bias."
61,-65.97,fox-news,"The year was the “Cats” of journalism – filled with stars and promise, but ultimately both creepy and embarrassingly bad. (Those of you who just pictured NBC Political Director Chuck Todd dressed as a cat can thank me for that lasting “Memory.”)"
62,-67.05,fox-news,"Unfortunately, we can expect journalism to get even worse in 2020, as the anti-Trump media do whatever they can to keep the president from being reelected."
63,-79.64,fox-news,"As we end 2019, we can look back at these seven worst media failures:"
64,0.0,fox-news,Impeachment
65,-47.67,fox-news,"President Trump’s impeachment wouldn’t have happened without an activist press leading the way. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said repeatedly she didn’t want to impeach Trump, knowing that the Republican-controlled Senate would never convict him and realizing the pointless exercise would hurt Democrats in the 2020 election."
66,86.58,fox-news,"Bit Democrats bowed to their most-strident supporters – journalists. This is why the news media celebrated the impeachment across nearly all outlets. And the allegedly neutral Washington Post political staff sent out a “Merry Impeachmas” tweet while they sat around with drinks, guacamole and smiles."
67,55.74,fox-news,"But now even some journalists realize they might have gone too far. Todd told the MSNBC audience that he was worried Trump would get out of jail free, just like O.J. Simpson: “I’m having a quick flashback to the O.J. trial,” he said."
68,-63.69,fox-news,Hatred of Trump
69,-70.96,fox-news,"The left-wing media hate Trump more than they hate anyone. It’s the foundation of everything they do, from Twitter snark to promoting the bogus impeachment."
70,-62.49,fox-news,Left-wing journalists have repeatedly compared Trump to the worst people in history.
71,-10.27,fox-news,"MSNBC host Donny Deutsch told viewers that Trump had “so many stunning parallels to what Hitler was doing in the early ’30s.” Then he added one of the memorably stupid comments of 2019: “I’m not saying Trump is going to slaughter 6 million Jews, but …”"
72,-20.23,fox-news,The media also hate Trump supporters. CNN Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter is one of many journalists who have referred to Trump voters as the “Trump cult.” He even inquired if the president was using “mind control.”
73,-62.49,fox-news,The worst of Times
74,-47.67,fox-news,"The New York Times made news the wrong way when the paper ran a legitimate headline about Trump in August. The headline in the print edition of the newspaper was only five words: “TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM.” (Yep, he did.)"
75,-66.21,fox-news,"Left-wing critics chimed in almost immediately, outraged that the accurate headline didn’t bash the president sufficiently. Everyone from Democratic presidential candidates to radical Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., skewered the paper."
76,-67.05,fox-news,Even its own staff. New York Magazine and HuffPost Contributor Yashar Ali tweeted that Times staffers “feel like their hard work is being sullied by a horrible headline.” They blamed it Executive Editor Dean Baquet.
77,-40.52,fox-news,Baquet caved first on the headline. The Times changed it in later editions to “ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS.”
78,-62.49,fox-news,"Then Baquet tried to mollify his staff by saying that the new narrative at the paper would be to hype racism, which we’ve already seen in the paper’s much-criticized 1619 Project."
79,-5.16,fox-news,Wag the dog
80,-90.81,fox-news,Few incidents show the collapse of journalism ethics more than ABC’s attempt to hype Turkey’s attack on the Kurds in Syria. The goal appeared to be to embarrass President Trump – who had pulled U.S. troops from the Kurdish-controlled portion Syria – and possibly draw the U.S. into war.
81,-63.69,fox-news,ABC’s Tom Llamas told the “ABC World News Tonight” audience that Trump was “effectively abandoning America’s allies in the fight against ISIS.” ABC then broadcast a video that Llamas said appeared to show “Turkey’s military bombing Kurdish civilians in a Syrian border town.”
82,-53.4,fox-news,Only it wasn’t. It was from a nighttime machine gun shoot held by a Kentucky gun range. The president mocked the “FAKE footage.” ABC apologized. But it ran the apology on its website and viewers never knew how badly the network fed them false information.
83,0.0,fox-news,Teens are off-limits?
84,-91.52,fox-news,The same media pros who freak out when anyone dares criticize teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg were quick to slam an entire high school. Journalists especially blamed student Nicholas Sandmann for a confrontation that happened in January.
85,-20.23,fox-news,"The Covington Catholic High School student was confronted by Native American activist Nathan Phillips, who began to beat a drum right in front of the teen’s face."
86,-54.81,fox-news,"Several journalists and news outlets blamed Sandmann, even though he did nothing wrong. He was accused of the grand crime of smirking! CNN anchor Chris Cuomo called the Covington students “victims of their own choices.”"
87,-42.15,fox-news,"The journalistic witch hunt was based on a selectively edited video and the fact that Sandmann was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. The horrendous news coverage spawned multiple, well-deserved defamation lawsuits."
88,0.0,fox-news,The Resistance
89,-29.6,fox-news,"Journalists have elevated anyone who represents The Resistance against Trump. But no one got more star treatment than now-disgraced anti-Trump attorney Michael Avenatti, who represented adult film star Stormy Daniels in her case against Trump."
90,74.3,fox-news,"That all crashed to Earth when Avenatti was charged for attempting “to extort more than $20 million from Nike,” wrote CNN. It was a huge fall from grace for the CNN and MSNBC favorite guest."
91,-47.54,fox-news,"Avenatti appeared on TV news a whopping 254 times in a year including 121 times on CNN and 108 on MSNBC. In one incredibly embarrassing 2018 interview, CNN’s Stelter even touted Avenatti as possible presidential timber."
92,0.0,fox-news,Russia collusion
93,-85.19,fox-news,"The Russia collusion narrative ran smack dab into reality this year. Journalists who spent at least 2,284 minutes on TV claiming the president was working with or for an American enemy failed to deliver any proof of their ridiculous claims."
94,-80.69,fox-news,As Politico explained: “Media stares down 'reckoning' after Mueller report underwhelms.” That was an understatement. It was a complete disaster – so bad that even prominent liberal journalists called out the media.
95,-89.01,fox-news,The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald summed up the media’s failure: “This was the single biggest story the US media fixated on for *3 years* & got the crux of it totally & completely wrong in a very damaging way.”
96,-7.72,fox-news,"Unfortunately, journalists haven’t learned a darn thing. And that summarizes 2019 as well as anything."
97,-38.18,the-new-york-times,Opinion | Darren Aronofsky: Greta Thunberg Is the Icon the Planet Desperately Needs
98,0.0,the-new-york-times,Turning Point: The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg sails across the Atlantic on an emissions-free yacht ahead of her arrival in New York on Aug. 28 for a tour of the Americas.
99,36.12,the-new-york-times,I have always had a deep connection with the natural world.
100,49.39,the-new-york-times,"Before I picked up a camera, I was first and foremost a student of Mother Nature. I spent summers during high school studying wildlife biology with the School for Field Studies, an environmental study-abroad program. As I learned about ungulates in Kenya and seals in Alaska, I developed a long-lasting fascination with nature. And though I left the field of environmental science to pursue film, a deep awe for our planet continues to inform every aspect of my work."
101,-36.12,the-new-york-times,"As a director, I’m in constant pursuit of the right image. And I’ll admit that I’ve often fallen prey to cynicism when looking for a visual to best convey the current state of the world, confronted as it is with such terrifying environmental challenges. It’s hard to be optimistic about the visual encapsulation of our dying planet."
102,59.94,the-new-york-times,"Yet, as soon as I saw an Instagram photo of Greta Thunberg staging her first environmental protest in August 2018, I knew. There she was, a 15-year-old girl, sitting outside the Swedish Parliament, on strike from school to bring attention to climate change. Here was the image — one of hope, commitment and action — I needed to see. An image that could spark a movement."
103,-29.6,the-new-york-times,Opinion | No More Phones and Other Tech Predictions for the Next Decade
104,62.49,the-new-york-times,"We haven’t quite dealt with all of the repercussions of tech’s domination of the past decade — there will be regulations, a lot of tech is still addictive, and digital hate will continue to travel halfway around the world before the truth gets out of bed — but there are some big, positive ideas that I think you will hear a lot more about in the coming years."
105,91.99,the-new-york-times,"While I have been a strong critic of tech, and it is easy to chew over what’s gone wrong — it makes for a large meal — I think it is more helpful, as 2020 dawns, to put forth five predictions that I hope will allow us to live more peacefully with the tech that we love and hate."
106,94.05,the-new-york-times,"More investment in tech that addresses climate change. With all due respect to Greta Thunberg and the efforts of young people across the globe to bring attention to climate change, governments may never agree on how to properly address our lurch toward environmental suicide. Which is why it is critically important that tech turn its focus toward creating products that will save us. The amount of investment in green technology remains stubbornly low compared with other tech sectors. Bill Gates and Elon Musk have been making more investments in this area, but they remain the only big names doing so. That’s too bad, since I think the world’s first trillionaire will be a green-tech entrepreneur. There are many areas to explore, including battery storage, renewables, software and artificial intelligence to help us understand climate data, the food ecosystem and even the way we construct our buildings. The most important challenge is finding a way to keep carbon in the ground — and figuring out the best way to do that provides a golden opportunity for entrepreneurs."
107,84.81,the-new-york-times,"Automation for good. There has been a lot of discussion about the job-killing potential of tech, including how an unholy combination of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence will be the death of employment. Many jobs will, in fact, be replaced by tech, especially ones that are rote and also many that are high paying in medicine, law and more. But this is also an opportunity to rethink the entire way we imagine employment and education. The smartest minds in tech should be thinking about reformulating and recalibrating the workplace and the structure of businesses. And rather than accept that poor pay and poor protections for gig workers are inevitable and that the pressures of a global work force are too hard to push back, tech companies should figure out how to creatively and humanely deploy talent across the world to show that they are interested in dealing with the consequences of their inventions."
108,94.68,the-new-york-times,"Is there a business in depolarization? I get that the forces of cynicism, manipulation and hate are forever on the digital march, but I am convinced that there is money to be made in appealing to our weariness with how our tech lives have been shaped. There are ways to foster digital interaction that do not have to incite rage. The reason much of social media feels so toxic is it has been built for speed, virality and attention grabbing rather than for context and accuracy. While it seems impossible to imagine a new kind of social-network product in the shadow of Facebook, TikTok, for all its controversy as a Chinese-owned company, has been a runaway success (the first big social success since Snapchat arrived in 2011), and there is room for more. There are opportunities to create new forms of communication that give the advantage to users — by strictly enforcing behavior standards and eliminating anonymity, and most of all, with advertising-based business plans that are not predicated on taking advantage of our personal data."
109,40.19,al-jazeera-english,What makes COP25 special?
110,40.19,al-jazeera-english,"Next week, the 25th Conference of Parties (COP) will kick off in Madrid, Spain. It was moved from Chile in ""a complete affront"" to Chilean civil society, which had called on the government to withdraw the military from the streets and continue to host the global climate talks."
111,-82.25,al-jazeera-english,"That the COP was moved is a scandal, but that it was done in fear of protests over rising inequality is also telling."
112,10.27,al-jazeera-english,"Never before have so many people taken to the streets as they did this September to protest over climate change. As a result, this is the first time in the 25 years that delegates have gathered to wrangle over climate policy that a COP has played out under such a watchful public eye."
113,-79.06,al-jazeera-english,"This year, 2019, has been a year of climate firsts and emergencies around the world. Last October's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report had a dramatic wake-up effect, dominating global headlines and driving home the realities of the latest science. From unprecedented fires in Brazil, the Arctic and Australia, to terrifying cyclones that laid waste to Mozambique and the Bahamas, to the flooding of Venice, the impacts are growing by the day."
114,-57.19,al-jazeera-english,Greta Thunberg too has mobilised the youth and media in a way no one anticipated when she first sat as a lonely figure outside the Parliament of Sweden in August 2018.
115,31.82,al-jazeera-english,"But the marching, striking youth are not just looking for emission commitments - although that is critically important - they are looking for an entire system overhaul. People have begun to connect the dots, and address the fact that climate change exacerbates every aspect of our fractured system."
116,-94.85,al-jazeera-english,"Climate change is a threat multiplier, and there is a fundamental inequality in how people are impacted, with the poorest and those less equipped to withstand climate shocks and stresses - essentially those who did the least to cause the crisis - bearing the brunt."
117,-87.2,al-jazeera-english,"Protesters, often led by young people, women and social movements on the front lines of these crises, are not marching about climate or inequality; they are standing up to the injustice of both. They are taking a stand against consumerism, because they see that the climate crisis is a direct result of a neoliberal system that prioritises profit over sustainability - a system that allows extractive business models to prosper while our planet suffers."
118,-39.62,al-jazeera-english,"Only 100 fossil fuel companies have been the source of more than 70 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 - emissions that have pushed our planet to the brink. A very small section of society has profited enormously, while poorer, more vulnerable communities all over the world are now on the front line, facing the consequences."
119,47.67,al-jazeera-english,Research from this year's Oxfam inequality report said that the world's 26 richest people own as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent. The scale of this societal inequality is astonishing.
120,45.88,al-jazeera-english,"Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, has seen his fortune increase to $112bn. According to Oxfam, just 1 percent of the fortune of the world's second-richest man is equivalent to the whole health budget for Ethiopia, a country of 105 million people."
121,-80.47,al-jazeera-english,"In fact, the wealth of the world's 2,208 dollar billionaires is now five times the gross domestic product (GDP) of the whole of Africa - a continent that has only contributed 2 percent of cumulative global emissions from energy over the last 100 years, but is now suffering from extreme droughts, food insecurity and storms."
122,-54.23,al-jazeera-english,"Yet, the political and industrial powers profiting from the status quo, making millions from business as usual, have started spinning stories and implementing policies that push the burden of the transition away from them on to individuals. Any transition to a carbon-neutral future is being presented as something to fear, something that will cost the average person either financially or in their quality of life."
123,-30.37,al-jazeera-english,"Yes, there will have to be some changes, but this harsh, negative and binary version of the future is being presented by those who have the most to lose from a transition to a clean, sustainable and fair economic system. In fact, we all have so much to gain."
124,27.32,al-jazeera-english,"This false narrative, and this culture of fear and blame, is driving far-right populism and enabling authoritarian leaders - forcing an unnecessary and imagined wedge between societies that should be united by what we share: A desire for a just and equal society, and a sustainable planet for us all to live on."
125,-47.67,al-jazeera-english,"If we can unite in the face of these forces trying to divide us, if we can join hands across the globe and refuse to be blamed, scared or pressurised by the bully tactics of the wealthy and powerful, this is a fight we can - and will - win."
126,90.14,al-jazeera-english,"We can create a financial system that does not invest in fossil fuel or deforestation but rather in solutions that benefit people most. We can work towards a zero-carbon world that has social justice at its heart. It is the wealthy who must pay and bear the costs of this transition that will ultimately lead to a fairer and more functional system, not the average person on the street. Big polluters must spend some of the enormous amounts of money they have made from pillaging our planet on implementing policies that benefit everyone, especially vulnerable communities."
127,0.0,al-jazeera-english,"Sometimes UN climate negotiations might seem dry and inaccessible - far from the movement on the streets. We must also acknowledge this year's quashing of civil dialogue, and the many voices, largely from the global south, locked out of this year's negotiations because of the last-minute move to Europe."
128,74.91,al-jazeera-english,"But at this COP, if we continue to stand together, the movements against the inequality and climate crises can show the powerful that we are not going anywhere. We must continue to work together to increase the public pressure until they act in the interests of the people, not the polluters and the billionaires."
129,-29.6,al-jazeera-english,"In Madrid, governments must move to step up climate ambition and action immediately. They must enact a socially just climate transition that leaves no one behind. They must show us that they are listening. That is the only way they can prove they have heard the demands of the people in Chile - and around the world."

131,0.0,al-jazeera-english,Britain's election and the deepening generational divide
132,45.88,al-jazeera-english,"The United Kingdom's December 12 general election was a huge disappointment for younger generations, as they were once again outnumbered and outvoted. Those above the age of 65 form an increasingly large share of the electorate, and are also more likely to vote. There are now more than 12 million UK citizens above the age of 65 and less than six million between the ages of 18 and 24. And, in this past election, 80 percent of those above 65 turned out to vote, compared with about 55 percent of 18 to 30-year-olds."
133,93.93,al-jazeera-english,"According to the Lord Ashcroft Election Day Poll, more than three-quarters of 18 to 24-year-olds (and more than 70 percent of 25 to 34-year-olds) supported left-leaning, socially liberal parties: The Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Scottish National Party. However, the youth vote was divided between these ""progressive"" parties, while the older generations overwhelmingly supported the Conservative Party (62 percent of those above 65 voted Conservative)."
134,95.95,al-jazeera-english,"The British first-past-the-post electoral system rewarded older generations for their block support for a single party and punished younger generations for sharing their vote between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The Liberal Democrats increased their overall support from 7.3 percent to 11.5 percent and the Greens from 1.6 percent to 2.7 percent, but gained no extra seats. This is why Boris Johnson's Conservative Party managed to win 44 percent of the general vote and a convincing majority of 80 seats in Parliament, even though it received the backing of only 19 percent (less than one in five) of the youngest group of voters."
135,0.0,al-jazeera-english,Rise of young cosmopolitans
136,-52.67,al-jazeera-english,"Over the past decade, young people in the UK have emerged as a cohesive political force - in strong support of British membership of the European Union and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party - but have suffered a string of electoral defeats to older generations."
137,10.27,al-jazeera-english,"The fact that they cannot yet singlehandedly carry a party to victory, however, does not mean their potential should be ignored."
138,7.72,al-jazeera-english,"In our 2019 book, Youthquake 2017: The Rise of Young Cosmopolitans in Britain, Professor Matt Henn and I demonstrated how the June 2017 general election was a landmark contest for young people."
139,83.6,al-jazeera-english,"There was a large increase in youth voter turnout, as age replaced class as the best predictor of voting intention. The youngest cohort (18 to 24-year-olds) turned out to vote at the highest rate for a quarter of a century - Ipsos MORI and YouGov estimated increases in youth turnout in 2017 of 15 percentage points and 16 percentage points, to 54 percent and 59 percent respectively."
140,-79.06,al-jazeera-english,"Younger generations have borne the brunt of the financial crisis: From a hostile labour market and the soaring costs of housing to savage public spending cuts and the trebling of university tuition fees to 9,000 pounds ($11,742) a year. After years of disillusionment with electoral politics, in 2017 they decided to go to the polls, because this time they were voting for a cause - ending cuts in public spending - and a party that they believe represents their progressive vision for the future - Corbyn's Labour. In the end, a landmark 62 percent of them supported Labour, helping deny Theresa May's Conservative Party a majority in the last Parliament."
141,0.0,al-jazeera-english,"In our book, we dubbed this phenomenon the rise of ""young cosmopolitans"" - a socially liberal, left-leaning cohort of young people."
142,0.0,al-jazeera-english,Deepening intergenerational fault-lines
143,45.76,al-jazeera-english,"In 2019, about a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds believed that poverty and the high cost of living were among the most important issues compared with just 10 percent of those over 65. Younger generations' support for greater public spending and state intervention is, therefore, the first intergenerational fault-line in British politics."
144,94.4,al-jazeera-english,"Lord Ashcroft polling reported that today's young people are also more relaxed about immigration and supportive of cultural diversity in comparison with older generations. Only 4 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds, and 18 percent of over 65s, believed that immigration was one of the most important issues facing the country. As a result, young Britons recognise the economic and cultural benefits of EU membership. In the 2016 Referendum, about three-quarters of 18 to 24-year-olds supported ""Remain"". Younger generations' support for ""cosmopolitan"" values constitutes the second intergenerational fault-line in British politics."
145,42.15,al-jazeera-english,"Yet, young people remain distrusting of mainstream parties and politicians in the backdrop of Brexit and austerity politics. This explains the appeal of Jeremy Corbyn, with his anti-austerity policies and anti-establishment credentials, and his deliberate efforts to connect with younger voters (from his appearance at the Glastonbury music festival in 2017 to the mobilisation of young activists through the Momentum campaign group)."
146,66.97,al-jazeera-english,"Since 2017 there has been a further ""youthquake"" in political participation that has materialised outside the arena of electoral politics. Hundreds of thousands of young people have participated in action against climate change, which has left the main political parties struggling to catch-up. It has also raised environmental issues to the top of young people's political agenda: In 2019, 32 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds believed it was one of the most important issues (the second-highest priority after the National Health Service) compared with only 10 percent of those above the age of 65 (the sixth-highest priority for this age group). Younger generations' support for environmental issues (another ""cosmopolitan"" value) constitutes the third intergenerational fault-line in British politics."
147,95.45,al-jazeera-english,"These intergenerational fault-lines are relevant to many other countries, where a highly-educated generation of young people share left-leaning cosmopolitan values and oppose socially conservative candidates and parties. In the United States, for example, Bernie Sanders, the radical Democratic Party presidential candidate, is particularly popular with young Democrats. On the other hand, only a quarter of 18 to 30-year-olds in the US approve of the job President Donald Trump is doing, compared with more than a half of over 65s."
148,-45.88,al-jazeera-english,"The youth movement for action against climate change is also international in character. The school strikes, inspired by Greta Thunberg, the teenage Swedish climate activist, spread through the internet and social media across the world. Within a year, the movement has grown from one girl protesting in a town square in Sweden, to a reported six million joining protests this September."
149,51.06,al-jazeera-english,"In British academia we have witnessed the surge in youth political engagement first-hand. The number of young people enrolling in politics degrees has risen by about a third since the Referendum in 2016. In an era of Brexit, Trump and - on the other side of the coin - Greta Thunberg, this generation of young people has become deeply politicised (if not enamoured with mainstream politicians and parties)."
150,-7.72,al-jazeera-english,"Despite the general election result, young people in Britain will continue to be engaged in politics by other means - from street demonstrations for Remain, to school strikes against climate change and direct action through Extinction Rebellion. If the past few years have shown us anything, it is that the arena of electoral politics is diminishing, while youth politics is increasingly bubbling up through social movements and other digitally networked forms of citizen action."
