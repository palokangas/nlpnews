Bronx Girl Seen Kidnapped in Video Admits It Was a Hoax, Official Says
The grainy black and white video showed a nightmarish scene in the Bronx.
A mother and her 16-year-old daughter were walking down a quiet street on Monday night when two men appeared and dragged the teenager into a vehicle.
New Yorkers were captivated for hours by the news on Tuesday, after an Amber Alert had been issued and video of the kidnapping spread online.
At first, there was good news: The girl, Karol Sanchez, had been found, unharmed.
Hours later, more disconcerting information surfaced: Karol confessed that it was all a hoax that stemmed from her difficult relationship with her mother, according to two police officials.
Shortly after she was found on Tuesday afternoon, Karol was questioned by officers from the 40th Precinct, where she admitted to setting up the kidnapping and then was released to her family. During the interview, one police official said Karol described her mother as “overprotective.”
