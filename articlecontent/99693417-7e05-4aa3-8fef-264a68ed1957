Greta Thunberg's 'urgent' book earns Waterstones author award
Greta Thunberg has been named author of the year by Waterstones for her "inspirational" book No One Is Too Small To Make A Difference.
The chain said the collection of the 16-year-old climate activist's speeches had an "urgent message".
Waterstones normally chooses a book of the year, but this year has added the accolade for author of the year.
It decided the best book of 2019 was Charlie Mackesy's The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse.
The former Spectator cartoonist's book combines his illustrations with a hand-written story of friendship between a boy and three animals.
"The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse is a wise and beautiful tale calling for love, friendship and courage," said Waterstones' Kate McHale.
"Greta Thunberg's speeches have been an inspiration to millions... Both choices are testament to the extraordinary power of books to move and shape us."
Waterstones said it had added the author prize this year to reflect "how strongly the titles resonated with our booksellers and customers".
Thunberg has not commented on the accolade. She recently turned down an environmental award and prize money, saying "the climate movement does not need any more awards".
