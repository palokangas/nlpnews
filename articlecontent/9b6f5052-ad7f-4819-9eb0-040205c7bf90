Climate Change Poses Threats to Children’s Health Worldwide
The health effects of climate change will be unevenly distributed and children will be among those especially harmed, according to a new report from the medical journal The Lancet.
The report compared human health consequences under two scenarios: one in which the world meets the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement and reins in emissions so that increases in global temperatures remain “well below 2 degrees Celsius” by the end of the century, and one in which it does not .
The report, published Wednesday, found that failing to limit emissions would lead to health problems caused by infectious diseases, worsening air pollution, rising temperatures and malnutrition.
“With every degree of warming, a child born today faces a future where their health and well -being will be increasingly impacted by the realities and dangers of a warmer world,” said Dr. Renee N. Salas , a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the United States policy brief that accompanied the report.
